	<h3>summary</h3>
	<p>Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin 
		Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary.[3] It tells four 
		intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. 
		The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, 
		Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and 
		hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for 
		their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. </p>

		<h3>Actors</h3>
		<ul>
			    <li><b>John Travolta as Vincent Vega:</b>

    Jules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Tarantino cast Travolta
					in Pulp Fiction because Michael Madsen, who had played Vic Vega 
					in Reservoir Dogs, chose to appear in Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp 
					instead. Madsen has since expressed regret over his decision. 
					Harvey Weinstein pushed for Daniel Day-Lewis in the part.
					Travolta accepted a reduced rate; sources say either US$100,000 
					or US$140,000. The film's success and his Academy Award nomination 
					for Best Actor revitalized his career. Vincent is the brother 
					of Vic Vega, also known as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs (1992), 
					and in 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring 
					Travolta and Madsen as the "Vega Brothers"; the concept remains 
					unrealized.
          </li>
			<br>
			<li><b> Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield:</b>

    Vincent's partner in crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Jackson's first 
				audition was overshadowed by Paul Calderón; Jackson had assumed 
				the audition was merely a reading. Weinstein convinced him to 
				audition a second time and his performance of the final diner 
				
				scene won over Tarantino. Jules was originally scripted 
				with a giant afro but Tarantino's PA mistakenly bought a 
				Jheri curled wig. Tarantino was enraged but Jackson persuaded 
				him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through
				the rap group N.W.A. Film critic Owen Gleiberman took it as 
				a "tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of [Black people] 
				in movies". Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best 
				Supporting Actor. Calderón appears in the film as Paul, 
				a bartender at Marsellus's social club, as well as Marsellus's 
				assistant. Tarantino wrote the role for Laurence Fishburne, who 
				turned it down. According to Tarantino, Fishburne refused it 
				because his team did not see it as a starring role;Fishburne 
				later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized 
				heroin.
</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b>Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace:</b>

    Wallace's wife and an aspiring actress. Miramax favored Holly Hunter or Meg Ryan 
				for the role of Mia. Alfre Woodard and Meg Tilly were also considered 
				but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting.She
				dominated the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with 
				cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting
				Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman
				chose not to do any big-budget films until Batman & Robin (1997) 
				three years later.
</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b>Harvey Keitel as Winston Wolfe:</b>

    

    A "cleaner" who aids Jules and Vincent. Tarantino wrote the part of Wolfe for 
				Keitel, who had starred in Reservoir Dogs and was instrumental in 
				its production. In Tarantino's words, "Harvey had been my favorite 
				
				actor since I was 16 years old." Keitel had played a similarly 
				employed character in Point of No Return (1993).
</li><br>
			<li> <b>Tim Roth as Ringo/"Pumpkin":</b>

    A burglar and Yolanda's boyfriend. Roth had starred in Reservoir Dogs alongside
				Keitel. He had used an American accent in Reservoir Dogs but used
				his natural, London accent in Pulp Fiction. Though Tarantino had 
				written the part with Roth in mind, TriStar head Mike Medavoy 
				preferred Johnny Depp or Christian Slater. Early in development, 
				Tarantino had contemplated casting Roth as Vincent and Gary Oldman as 
				Jules, rewriting the characters as "two English guys".
</li><br>
   <li> <b>Amanda Plummer as Yolanda/"Honey Bunny":</b>

    Ringo's girlfriend and partner in crime. Tarantino wrote the role of Yolanda 
	   for Plummer to partner her with Roth. Roth had introduced Tarantino to her, 
	   saying: "I want to work with Amanda in one of your films but she has to have 
	   a really big gun."
</li><br>
   <li> <b>Maria de Medeiros as Fabienne:</b>

    Butch's girlfriend. Tarantino met de Medeiros, a Portuguese actress, while 
	   traveling with Reservoir Dogs around the European film festival circuit.
</li>
    <br>
    <li> <b>Ving Rhames as Marsellus Wallace:</b> 

    A crime boss and employer of Jules and Vincent. Before Rhames was cast, 
		the part of Wallace was initially offered to Max Julien and Sid Haig, 
		but both turned down the role. According to Bender, Rhames gave 
		"one of the best auditions I've ever seen". His acclaimed performance
		led to him being cast in big-budget features such as Mission Impossible 
		(1996), Con Air (1997) and Out of Sight (1998).
</li>
			<li><b>  Eric Stoltz as Lance:</b>
  
			 Vincent's drug dealer. Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among 
			TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl 
			Spivey in True Romance (1993).</li>
<br>
    <li> <b>Rosanna Arquette as Jody:</b>

    Lance's wife. Pam Grier read for the role, but Tarantino did not believe
		audiences would find it plausible for Lance to yell at her. Tarantino 
		later cast Grier as the lead role for Jackie Brown. Ellen DeGeneres also
		read for the part of Jody. Rosanna's sister Alexis (then known as 
		Robert Arquette) also appears in the film, as a man emerging from 
		bathroom to shoot at and miss Vincent and Jules who then kill him.
</li>
			<br>
    <li> <b>Christopher Walken as Captain Koons:</b>

    A USAF veteran of the Vietnam War who delivers a young Butch his 
		father's coveted gold watch. During Koons' monologue, which is 
		interspersed with colorful descriptions of the Viet Cong, he 
		mentions a soldier called "Winocki".[b] Joe Winocki (John Garfield) 
		is a character in the 1943 film Air Force directed by Howard Hawks, 
		one of Tarantino's favorite directors. Tarantino played a character 
		named Desmond Winocki in a guest appearance on an episode of All-American
		Girl titled Pulp Sitcom.
</li>
			<br>
    <li><b>Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge:</b> 

    An aging boxer on the run from Marsellus having double-crossed him. 
		Willis was already a star but most of his recent films had been 
		critical and box-office disappointments. As related by Peter Bart,
		participating in the modestly budgeted film "meant lowering his 
		salary and risking his star status but the strategy ... paid off 
		royally: Pulp Fiction not only brought Willis new respect as an
		actor but also earned him several million dollars".
		Willis' appearance and physical presence were crucial to Tarantino, 
		"Bruce has the look of a 50s actor. I can't think of any other star 
		that has that look". Butch's look was modeled on Aldo Ray in 
		Nightfall and his demeanor based on Ralph Meeker's portrayal of 
		
		Mike Hammer in Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly. Chandler 
		Lindauer plays a young Butch.
